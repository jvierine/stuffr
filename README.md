# Stuff from R

The most hated Python module ever written. These are routines I made when I started using Python. As I had previously used R as an interpreted language, the module became "stuffr", meaning stuff from R. Unfortunately most of my code has a dependency to this module. 

You can install it using:
> pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ stuffr
